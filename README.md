## Given assignment
Create as best as possible route, which depends on visited cities ratings. Given cities csv files contain information about cities, routes csv files contain available routes between cities and information about those routes.

The assignment is made of several parts:

1. Implement a program, that provides an optimal solution to the given problem. Determine at what data volume the solution can be found if the program execution time cannot be longer than 10 seconds.
1. Implement a program, that would provide the result to the given problem using the "locally best" solution (e.g. with several choices to travel to different vertices, always choose: the cheapest or the shortest or ... path).
1. Implement a program, that would provide a solution using Genetic Optimization
method. The program must provide result within no more than 60 seconds.

### Restrictions:
+ Travel start and end city must the same
+ Travel time can't exceed 48 hours
+ Same city can be visited several times, but additional visit points are not added
